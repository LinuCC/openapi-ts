## First Steps

There are many ways to contribute to Hey API. Most of them don't involve writing any code!

- **Read the documentation**. Start with the [Get Started](/openapi-ts/get-started) guide. If you find anything broken or confusing, you can suggest improvements by clicking "Edit" at the bottom of any page.

- **Browse open issues**. Help others by providing workarounds, asking for clarification, triaging, or suggesting labels on [open issues](https://github.com/hey-api/openapi-ts/issues). If you see something you would like to work on, consider opening a pull request.

- **Participate in discussions**. Ask or [answer questions](https://github.com/orgs/hey-api/discussions), provide feedback, or suggest new ideas. Every idea is welcome, no matter how big or small.

- **Engage on social media**. Help others discover Hey API by engaging with our posts on [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/company/heyapi), [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/heyapi.dev), or [X](https://x.com/mrlubos). Share your experiences with Hey API on Reddit, Slack, or in your own communities and group chats.

- **Create a new issue**. If you can't find a solution, [open an issue](https://github.com/hey-api/openapi-ts/issues). The issue template will guide you through the process.

- **Open a pull request**. If you find an issue you would like to fix, open a pull request. If you need help, tag [`@mrlubos`](https://github.com/mrlubos) on GitHub, provide enough relevant information, and we will do our best to assist you.

These are some of the best ways not only to contribute to Hey API, but also to learn, connect with others, and share ideas.
