# Validators

There are times when you cannot blindly trust the server to return the correct data. You might be working on a critical application where any mistakes would be costly, or you're simply dealing with a legacy or undocumented system.

Whatever your reason to use validators might be, you can rest assured that you're working with the correct data.

## Features

- seamless integration with `@hey-api/openapi-ts` ecosystem
- schemas for requests, responses, and reusable definitions

## Options

Hey API natively supports the following validators.

- [Valibot](/openapi-ts/plugins/valibot)
- [Zod](/openapi-ts/plugins/zod)
- [Ajv](/openapi-ts/plugins/ajv) <span data-soon>Soon</span>
- [Arktype](/openapi-ts/plugins/arktype) <span data-soon>Soon</span>
- [Joi](/openapi-ts/plugins/joi) <span data-soon>Soon</span>
- [TypeBox](/openapi-ts/plugins/typebox) <span data-soon>Soon</span>
- [Yup](/openapi-ts/plugins/yup) <span data-soon>Soon</span>
